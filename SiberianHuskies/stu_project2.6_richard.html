  <h1>Siberian Huskies: Well Adapted for the Snow!</h1>
  <p>Siberian Huskies are well suited for the snow.  They have fur between the pads of their paws to protect their paws from freezing.  There is fur inside their ears and their ears can bend back until they are snug against their head.  Siberian Huskies have very busy tails that are used to protect their eyes and nose while they sleep.  While sleeping, Huskies curl up in a ball, using their tails to cover their faces.  Their tails protect their eyes and warm the air that is going into their nose and mouth while they sleep.  While running, a Husky’s tail never gets in the way because it curls up over their backs.  Huskies even wear two coats (including a downy undercoat) of fur to keep them warm!</p>
