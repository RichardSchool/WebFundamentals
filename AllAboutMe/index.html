<h2>A Place to Visit</h2>

<p>I would like to visit China for a whole year. My whole family lives in China and it would be nice to visit them for a whole year and learn about what they do and Chinese culture.<br><br></p>

<!-- I want to go learn more about Chinese culture -->

<h2>Me as a Cartoon</h2>

<p>If I'm totally honest, I've never watched a cartoon before, or watch movies so I can't really answer this.<br><br></p>

<h2>A Dream Come True</h2>

<p>I'd like to interact with anything in the world without touching it, so then I don't have to get up to do things and type and do schoolwork.<br><br></p>
